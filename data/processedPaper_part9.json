Boulding repudiates superficial features of the “Austrian” theory of capital as a matter of a production or investment period, there is danger that his clever mathematical treatment of the single investment in terms of time may lend support to such a position. Examination of the Austrian theory; its main fallacy lies in attributing production of capital goods to “primary” factors, in ignoring organic cooperation of all productive agencies, and in the fact that all are like capital goods in essential respects, 40.— Examination of Mr. Boulding's analogies of population and of lake and stream shows both faulty, 52.— Relations between two views of capital, as continuous or as cyclically produced, consumed and reproduced; necessity of preferring the continuity view, 63.— Basis of production period fallacies is in a confusion of things with values; value production is always instantaneous; it is impossible to treat the production of new capital as the production of its income yield thru future time, which would make the “period” infinite, 64.",

    "abstract": "The historical development of the theory of costs has been away from the disutility analysis of the classicists. — The view that costs are payments for the means of production, arising out of the resistances which they occasion, and set in a competitive price-bidding process, 36. — These resistances resolved into eight scarcity-factors, which are the fundamental elements of costs, 41. — The analysis applied to costs encountered in business enterprise: wages, interest, rents, depreciation, insurance, taxes, and profits. — All can be broken down into the eight elements named 47. — The introduction of monopoly profits into the prices of materials necessitates a distinction between competitive and restrictive costs, 59. — This analysis of costs suggests that an approach to the theory of distribution along similar lines would be fruitful, 62.",

    "abstract": "Cycles of approximately eight years in the yield per acre of British crops have probably recurred in a continuous series during the last one hundred and sixty years. In consequence of the law of demand, these crop cycles have generated corresponding cycles in the prices of food and of organic raw materials. In conformity with the law of competitive price, the cycles in the prices of food and of raw materials should have been followed by corresponding cycles in the prices of manufactured commodities. As a matter of fact, the analysis of Sauerbeck's index numbers of general wholesale reveals real cycles of approximately eight years in which the originating, generating crop cycles are reflected throughout the century for which the Sauerbeck index numbers have been computed.The principal results of the investigation appear in the graphs of Figures 5 and 6.I.
